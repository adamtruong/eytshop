1|Rich Dad Poor Dad|Robert T. Kiyosaki|9.99|Business & Money|336|While there is a milestone to honor — and a new section in the book on Why Milestones Are Important — maintaining the original content demonstrates that this book has genuinely weathered the test of time. The book's sidebars (which were updated for the 20th anniversary edition) have been updated again, but the core principles that parents and grandparents embraced 25 years ago are now being shared with new generations who have discovered that its timeless wisdom and no-nonsense lessons can be applied to anyone's life and their vision for a future that includes taking control of their finances.\n\nMilestones are celebrated by people from many cultures and regions. We use them to track time, track progress, reflect on lessons gained, and celebrate achievements... They provide purpose to our life's journey. They are a means for us to merge the past, present, and future... looking back at where we started, where we are now, and the hope of what the future can bring.\n\nSo much has changed in our world in the quarter century since Rich Dad Poor Dad was originally published - 25 years since April 8, 1997. But one thing has remained constant: the critical need of financial education. Whether we like it or not, money is still an important part of our lives, and technology has brought both speed and creativity to the realm of money. In an ever-changing environment, we can all grow smarter about money... and learn everything we can to ensure our future.

5|Think and Grow Rich|Napoleon Hill|7.49|Business & Money|320|Think and Grow Rich has been referred to be the "Grandfather of All Motivational Literature." It was the first book to address the provocative question, "What makes a winner?" Napoleon Hill, the guy who asked and waited for the response, is now regarded as one of the world's greatest victors.\nThe most famous of all success gurus spent "a fortune and the best part of a lifetime of labor" developing the "Law of Success" theory that underpins his books and is so succinctly described in this one.\n\nHill uses anecdotes from Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, and other millionaires of his period to illustrate his concepts in the original Think and Grow Rich, published in 1937. Arthur R. Pell, Ph.D., a nationally known author, lecturer, and consultant in human resources management and an expert in applying Hill's thought, deftly interweaves anecdotes of how contemporary millionaires and billionaires, such as Bill Gates, Mary Kay Ash, Dave Thomas, and Sir John Templeton, attained their wealth in the updated version. To avoid stumbling barriers for a new generation of readers, outdated or esoteric vocabulary and examples are carefully revised.
