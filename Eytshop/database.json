We use them to track time, track progress, reflect on lessons gained, and celebrate achievements... They provide purpose to our life's journey. They are a means for us to merge the past, present, and future... looking back at where we started, where we are now, and the hope of what the future can bring.\n\nSo much has changed in our world in the quarter century since Rich Dad Poor Dad was originally published - 25 years since April 8, 1997. But one thing has remained constant: the critical need of financial education. Whether we like it or not, money is still an important part of our lives, and technology has brought both speed and creativity to the realm of money. In an ever-changing environment, we can all grow smarter about money... and learn everything we can to ensure our future.",

Arthur R.
